• Capture fine-grained non-uniform depression patterns through temporal classification for better depression detection.  
• Propose one-hot policy and Hubert policy to generate pseudo CTC-label for alignment over multiple hierarchical stages of speech signals.  
• The dynamic pattern of non-uniform depression states is verified through differential decoded CTC-label distribution.  
• Word-level sequential modeling is shown to be the most promising configuration for depression detection and has great compatibility with ASR features on English and Mandarin datasets.  
• The generic methods are applicable for paralinguistic speech processing tasks, such as emotion recognition, and Alzheimer’s disease detection.
