title: Unsupervised IDL Pretraining for Depression Detection from Speech
description:
importance: 3
category: fun

• A generic unsupervised pretraining framework, Instance Discriminative Learning (IDL), is proposed to train a high-level, low-dimensional feature extractor for downstream task initialization.  
• Investigate various augmentation methods in the pretraining stage and analyze their effects w.r.t depression state.  
• Explore the correlation between speaker-identity information and depression status by setting sampling strategies in the pretraining stage.  
• Propose a novel sampling technique, Pseudo-instance Sampling (PIS), to utilize clustering algorithms to reveal a deeper correlation between IDL embeddings and underlying acoustic units (depression status, specifically).  
• With the help of the ablation speaker classification study, we verify that speaker-related information might help with depression classification, i.e. widely-used speaker-related features can also be used to distinguish depression status.
