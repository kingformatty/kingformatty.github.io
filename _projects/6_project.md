• Investigate different input representations including Padding and Filling (PAF), Structured Data Embedding (SDE), and Boundary Based Embedding (BBE).  
• Design multiple encoder-decoder models with an attention mechanism. Implement Transformer and compare.  
• Regularize the model with the proposed NOS method, to control the complexity of the generated sentences in a soft manner. By applying NOS, the generated sentences are forced to have more subordinate sentences rather than the concatenation of simple sentences.
