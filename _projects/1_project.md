title: Depression Detection with Acoustic Cue and Linguistic Cue from LLM
importance: 1
category: work

---

• Significance of depression from linguistics and acoustics varies across individuals. Some tend to have more salient
patterns in terms of monotonic pitch, and hesitation, but others tend to choose different words.
• The first approach tries to exploit the potential of large language models in depression detection, in addressing the
challenge of inter-correlation between acoustic and linguistic cues.
• Asynchronous alignment between significant acoustic cues and linguistic cues.
• Experiments will be conducted over English and Mandarin datasets to verify robustness across various domains.
