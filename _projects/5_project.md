• Propose novel Non-speech Discriminative Loss (NSDL) to handle the majority of long-term non-speech segments within utterances, including laugh, hesitation, and noise.  
• Utilize novel Bi-APC unsupervised pretraining strategy to learn common knowledge from the untranscribed dataset.  
• Apply Incremental Semi-Supervised Learning (ISSL) to generate pseudo transcriptions for the untranscribed dataset in multiple folds. (Filter the pseudo transcription by log-likelihood)  
• Augment the data using VTLP, Speed Perturbation, Pitch Perturbation, Volume Perturbation, and Noise Perturbation (background and foreground).  
• Improve the results through language model re-scoring.
