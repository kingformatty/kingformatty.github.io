title: Privacy-preserving Depression Detection with Speaker Disentanglement
description:
importance: 3
category: work
---

• Propose an adversarial minimization-maximization technique to attenuate speaker-related information and preserve depression characteristics. Address the privacy concern when applying automatic systems in clinic use cases.  
• Propose a novel Non-uniform Speaker Disentanglement framework to leverage differential behaviors between model layers, in terms of extracting depression/speaker information with varying quality and quantity.  
• Three non-adversarial approaches based on loss equalization across speakers with KL-divergence/Variance/Cross-entropy  are proposed to resolve the instability issue in adversarial methods.
